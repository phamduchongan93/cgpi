I am using this to replace an aging Vantage Pro station. Several things which I like better about the Ecowitt:
1. No console: uses a simple and inexpensive gateway module instead.
2. Data can be viewed from anywhere, using a cell phone app or a web browser.
3. Compatible with almost any operating system, including Linux and Raspberry Pi.
4. Gateway module connects all data to a 2.4 MHz WiFi network (required).
5. Except for the gateway, all sensors are powered by their own batteries, so they can be sited independently. (And the gateway does remember it's settings during power outages).
7. Once you have completed, the setup, you will have remote viewing from the Ecowitt server via cellphone or browser, and can easily set up Weather Underground as well.

The only disadvantages compared to the Vantage Pro are:
1. Does not come with a solar radiation shield for the exterior temperature/humidity sensor
2. Rain gauge collector is relatively shallow, so it won't accurately measure snow melt.

Setup was pretty straightforward, although the Quick Start Guide and the Manual are somewhat confusing in their description of the steps involved; be sure to keep both of them handy while setting up the gateway. Once that is accomplished, the rest of setup is pretty straightforward.

The temperature and humidity readings will vary slightly between different sensors, but even before calibration they were all within about +/- 2 F or +/-2% humidity. Calibration allows you to specify offsets for each temperature and humidity sensor. Once that is done the sensors track fairly well.

If a known accurate thermometer and hygrometer are available, then just tweak the sensor offsets until all the readings agree. If not, then set up all the sensors in one room where the temperature is fairly constant, and allow them to equalize for at least an hour. At that point, you can calculate the mean temperature and humidity reading, and the offset (difference) between each sensor and the mean (a small spreadsheet is handy for this). Enter these offset values to calibrate each sensor.

Note that the indoor sensor attached to the gateway module needs good ventilation since it generates a small amount of internal heat, which could throw off calibration unless it is properly ventilated. Place it and the other sensors at least a foot or two away from the gateway module or any other sources of heat, and elevate the indoor sensor a few inches to allow air to flow around it.

For the outdoor temperature/humidity sensor, I am using a LaCrosse 925-1418 Sensor Protection Shield (Ecowitt has a very similar one, but it is not currently available on Amazon). Note that this type of shield has to be mounted out of direct sunlight; I put it on the back of a porch pillar.
