| **Note** (An)            | I would recommend the first 2 months of the project to rely on the network campus without disclosing the services deployed, since most of the sensors donâ€™t require a lot of bandwidth. However, throughout the project, the bandwidth will increase knowing video streaming services would be deployed and implemented (due to outdoor camera devices), which is believed to start in the Fall semester. |                                 |                                                                                                              |
