# Build with AWS 
- This is the current build that community garden has been implementing for summer build. The AWS IoT Core was introduced by database team. Although, there are features and addons for this service, this AWS IoT Core software is a mqtt message broker. since AWS IoT Core is open source, their is now fee involve while using this software.

# Build with Self Hosted Soluation:
- Due to the recent upgrade of raspberry pi 4. The potential of running message broker on raspberry pi is possible as well as running a a web-based dashboard. This new hardware upgrade helps to reduce the reliance on AWS cloud.

- In short, this build is stable and well supported around the electronics enthuists. Additionally, the supply of open hardware is more avaible and budget friendly toward consummer. The only limitation is that the lack of automation and scalability for this model. Compare AWS cloud based solution, this require user manually install the required services and need an end program or an end user to verify the usability.
