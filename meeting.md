# Meeting Note:
- Building off-grid system. 
- Being Agile.
- Defining and building bucket for logging. 
- Getting message system ready for s3 bucket.

# Report
- Hope you are doing well.
- To have a insight look for documentation of the project, please visit cpp.anpham.me. 
- Knowing that we try to apply "agile" for the project. Tasks and operations are divided into parts. 
- Knowning this project is funded by AWS grant, I would try to implement new technology stack that make us this project less rely on AWS as provider. This approach is due to the opportunity of having new technolgoy stack that has been developed by single board community. This tech stack is maturely tested, supported, and popular to educational community. As for Davis Weather Station, with previous approach of Melvin and Peter, I was able to put together a webpage dashboard for remote viewing. To be clear, our weather station so far does not rely  on AWS. I can install a monitoring station inside the office as well as remote page to convey the sensors. As dicussed before, we won't able to garther the soil sensors for the agricultural group which we listed as requirement. 
- I also added one of Professor to our supporter list, we had some discussion before regarding Community Garden project. The scope of discussion is narrawed to network deployment concern. He also mentioned IT department should be one of our stakeholders since we are going to consume soome of their network bandwith. However, right now this is not really our concern since most of our dataset are sensors data. Unless you guys want to have the outdoor camera installed for remote monitoring which require some wiring work for the camera inside the box, we are going to need more bandwith for the camera. 
- I try to install the solar indoor while letting the pannel faces the window to charge the battery. The solar only charge around 0-7V which is not enough to charge the battery and power the weather station.
- After July, we should able to record a webinair to demonstrate our tech stack for software side.
- If you have any further concern regarding the deliverable matter of this project, feel free to reach out to me.
