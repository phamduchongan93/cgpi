Build with Self Hosted Soluation: Due to the recent upgrade of raspberry pi 4. The potential of running message broker on raspberry pi is possible as well as running a a web-based dashboard. This new hardware upgrade helps to reduce the reliance on AWS cloud. Visit the following link for information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DO2wHI6JWQ&ab_channel=LearnEmbeddedSystems In short, this build is stable and well supported around the electronics enthuists. Additionally, the supply of open hardware is more avaible and budget friendly toward consummer. The only limitation is that the lack of automation and scalability for this model.

The AWS IoT as mqtt message broker only able to receive message from weewx service, however this is a simple query that fetch info and send it to AWS IoT Core. In short, the communication is not statefull. Because of this limitation, storage mechanism has to be inititated. I set up a bucket to store the data from weewx on AWS cloud. Refer to video to have a better understand the architect of AWS IoT. To achieve continunity and cost effective when running IoT services, creating a single channel stream is the best option to operate the IoT projects.
