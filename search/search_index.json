Additionally, the supply of open hardware is more avaible and budget friendly toward consummer. The only limitation is that the lack of automation and scalability for this model. Compare AWS cloud based solution, this require user manually install the required services and need an end program or an end user to verify the usability.   </li> </ul>"},{"location":"analysis/Network%20Analysis/","title":"Alternative Analysis","text":"Alternative 1 ( Running EC2 VPN) Alternative 2 ( Running router) Alternative 3 (reactivate 4g providers) Initial Cost $0.00 $40.00 $0.00 Monthly Cost $7.00 $0.00 $90.00 Expected Time (months) 9.00 9.00 9.00 Description IT and campus Involvement Benefit Alternative 1 Initiate Eduroam wifi from the school and spin up VPN server High Bypass IT firewall.  Student credential is stored on the sd card (security issue). Can deploy more services. Alternative 2 Purchase router to connect campus network Medium (due to isolation) Private network, but the cost is high when two stations are in different locations Alternative 3 Reactivate 4g providers $90 for 2 sensors station. none Alternative 4 Activate 4g hotspot $25 per station none private network, two stations can connect one hotspot. Note (An) I would recommend the first 2 months of the project to rely on the network campus without disclosing the services deployed, since most of the sensors don\u2019t require a lot of bandwidth. However, throughout the project, the bandwidth will increase knowing video streaming services would be deployed and implemented (due to outdoor camera devices), which is believed to start in the Fall semester.
