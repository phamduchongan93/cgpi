Weather Sensor Station Example: Weather Station. DSL cable (R11/R12 cable) - used to connect sensors. Internet connection. SD card. Overview This is page is dedicated to describe the architect and technical aspect of Community Garden IoT Project. There are three parts of documentation which are guide for installation, AWS device troubleshooting, Data Monitoring. Pay attention to release of the document since the Road Map Deploy sensors weather station. Feed data stream to AWS ecosystem. Architecture: Grid vs Off Grid Design: Grid like design, the community garden system would receive the energy provided from residential and commerical building directly. Losing certain piece of data data due to power outtage is possible since back up energy is not factored in the cost. While there is risk involve is low since data collected is farming sensors. Off Grid design, IoT computer and sensors are can be running via solar system, however number of sensors are limited. Installation Guide Install community garden script from the github for latest version. To verify the Install weewx and database software for weather station. Testing open hardware sensors for soil measurement. Project Component: Davis Advantage Pro 2 (weather station) weewix configuration.","title":"Welcome to Community Garden Documentation"},{"location":"#welcome-to-community-garden-documentation","text":"","title":"Welcome to Community Garden Documentation"},{"location":"#requirement","text":"Raspberry pi 2/3/4 or Linux based compunter.

However, throughout the project, the bandwidth will increase knowing video streaming services would be deployed and implemented (due to outdoor camera devices), which is believed to start in the Fall semester.
